# digitClassifier

Machine Learning model using Python for classifying handwritten digits into one of the 10 classes representing integers from 0 to 9.

Implemented Softmax Regression using PyTorch library of Python and used MNIST dataset of torchvision library.

Divided the 60000 examples into 600 batches of size 100 for training and developing the model.

Implemented 2-layer Neural Network and calculated Cross Entropy Loss for modifying parameters.
